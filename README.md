 Hi, this is a block from the BarniCoin Blockchain. If you wish to add to this blockchain and do the following:
  ## Todo: 
 - Open the Blocks directory
 - In the Blocks directory create or copy the last javascript file and rename it with the next number in the chain.
 - Ex: initial file: 0002_block.js your file: 0003_block.js ...
 - in the function bellow you need to enter 3 things
 - the number of you block
 - Your Name, or nike  - optional , if not then eneter "null"
 - Your github account link  - optional, if not then eneter "null"

`createBlock(number, "UserName", "//github.com/username");`

Now you need to add a link in the index.html file to your new javascript file <!--JavaScript for adding a nes Block  -->
### Ex: `<script src="./Blocks/0003_block.js"></script>`

// Thank your for your contribution
